# Shel scripts for starting new projects

Recently I realized that I do a lot of repetitive steps when starting a new project. So I started to wander if there was a way to automate that process.

Of course, I could have done this in a lot of different languages such as Python, C, PHP or any other, but I decided I wanted to do this in shel script (bash).

Now some of you might be asking yourself "But why would you do that in bash?", and my answer to you is why wouldn't I. 

I've done some minor stuff with it before but never really gotten to deep into learning it or truly trying to find out how it all works. I always viewed it as something you would see in movies when they show those "hacking" scenes.

I always admired people who could write and understood what it does. So I decide the best way to learn it was to get my hands dirty with it. I started by trying to come up with an idea for what the script should do some basic concepts. And that is how all of this started.
